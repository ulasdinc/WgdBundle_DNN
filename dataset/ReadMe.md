This folder provides the dataset of digits used in the article. The file is d_all_norm256.zip, which provides a .mat file where there are 1170 examples of 256x256 pixels (Hence the dimension is 1170x256x256) of patterns of digits with different thicknesses, randomly scaled and rotated. Note that, in the BPM code, the inputs are zero-padded and resized to obtain proper sampling for the accurate BPM simulation. At the end of the BPM simulation, the outputs are again cropped and resized to obtain 256x256 (matching the given input size and pixellation). For the next step of reconstruction with the U-net, we end up with many (in this case, 1170) 256x256 input patterns (outputs of the BPM) and many (in this case, 1170) 256x256 ground-truths (inputs of the BPM).
